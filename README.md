VIM-KICKSTART
=============

Script to install some of my favourites vim packages in several computers without having to checkout every time how to install it.

----------

## Usage ##

Just download the code and execute the script:

    git clone https://github.com/alejandrogallo/vim-kickstart.git
    cd vim-kickstart
    ./vim-kickstart

The code is self-explanatory, so if you want to add other packages 
go ahead.

Mac Users
-------
I assume Mac users use the package manager [brew](https://brew.sh),  specially for the vim package [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe), you should update your vim version. 

## Disclaimer ##

Theoretically the script shouldn't erase any information in the directory *.vim* or in the file *.vimrc*, however backing them up doesn't hurt.
