VIM-KICKSTART
=============

# THIS README IS OUTDATED, DO NOT FOLLOW IT #

Script to install some of my favourites vim packages in several computers without having to checkout every time how to install it.

----------

## Usage ##

Just download the code and execute the script:

    git clone https://github.com/alejandrogallo/vim-kickstart.git
    cd vim-kickstart
    ./vim-kickstart

The code is self-explanatory, so if you want to add other packages 
go ahead. I use mainly the package manager [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).


## Disclaimer ##

Be careful
